## Common Issues

### "No books found in wishlist"
- Make sure wishlist is set to **Public** in Amazon settings
- Check URL format: `https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/XXXXXXXXX`

### Library searches timing out
- This is normal - just retries and continues
- Check SESSION_NOTES.md for details

### Duplicates in results
- Fixed! Deduplication is enabled
- Different formats shown separately (Book, eBook, Audiobook)
